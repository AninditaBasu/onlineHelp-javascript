<p>Sometimes, a few lines of JavaScript is all it takes to make an online help system more friendly. Footnotes and glossary terms displayed on mousever, sections of a page presented as horizontal tabs, additional information that can be revealed or hidden on click &mdash; all of these are things that enhance UX.</p>

<p>And then, there's you, the writer. What about WX (writer experience)? What if there was a way to write something once, and then reuse it across multiple files in the same folder? Everyone says you need DITA for that, but that's not true. HTML has something called transclusion that was made just for this scenario. Include a few of lines of JavaScript to your HTML files, and you have the conref feature of DITA right in HTML.</p>

<p>Code samples and example implementations are available for download from GitHub.</p>

<p>The files use the jQuery and the jQuery UI libraries, and are implemented through the <code>class</code> attribute of HTML elements. Therefore, you can use these effects of any element that can take a <code>class</code> attribute.</p>
