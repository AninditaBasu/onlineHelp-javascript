__JavaScript snippets for HTML files in an online help system__

If the final output of your online help files is HTML, you can include these code snippets in your HTML transforms. The snippets use the jQuery and jQueryUI library. All of the effects are implemented through classes and will work on any HTML or DITA element that can take a class attribute.

The following JavaScript effects are available:

-    Content referencing in HTML
-    Show or hide blocks of content on demand
-    Show the content of a footnote on hover
-    Display the sections of a large page in horizontal tabs instead of vertical sections

Usage instructions and working examples are in [documentation](./html/documentation.html).
