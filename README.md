javascript code for HTML files in your online help

If the final output of your online help files is HTML, you can include these code snippets in your HTML transforms.
All of the effects are implemented through classes and will work on any HTML element that can take a class attribute.

The files use the jQuery and jQueryUI library.

For details about these files, read the documentation.html file.
