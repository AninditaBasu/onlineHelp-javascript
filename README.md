__JavaScript snippets for HTML files in an online help system__

If the final output of your online help files is HTML, you can include these code snippets in your HTML transforms. The snippets use the jQuery and jQueryUI library. All of the effects are implemented through `class` attributes and will work on any HTML or DITA element that can take a `class` attribute.

## Features

The following JavaScript effects are available:

-    Content referencing in HTML
-    Show or hide blocks of content on demand
-    Show the content of a footnote on hover
-    Display the sections of a large page in horizontal tabs instead of vertical sections

## Installation and use

Download this entire repository as a `.zip` file and look at the files. Usage instructions and working examples are in `html` > `documentation.html`.

## Bugs and enhancements

Use GitHub's issue tracking feature.
